Feed Forward MLP Library with Matlab

### Notes
* requires Matlab R2016b or later
* also Matlab sux

### Coding Matlab in a text editor and running in a terminal shell

Add these lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`:
```
export PATH=/Applications/Matlab_R20XXx.app/bin:$PATH
# or wherever matlab is on your computer
# if you don't know where matlab is, open the matlab gui and run 'matlabroot'

alias matlab="matlab -nodisplay -nosplash"
# now you can just run '$ matlab' to start a matlab session
```
